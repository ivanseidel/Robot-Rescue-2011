# RoboCup Rescue A 2011 Software (OBR)

This is the code developed by our team on the 2011 National RoboCup Rescue A
(OBR: Olimpiada Brasileira de Rob√≥tica).

We could achieve the best time, with the highest score possible.

The robot used an `NXT` running a `C` Program with `RobotC`. We also added an custom
Arduino board plugged to the `NXT` that communicated by `I2C` to read 4 Ultrasonic Sensors
and activate 4 Servos from `VEX`.
